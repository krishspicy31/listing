# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* Successfully launch the MVP platform within the planned timeframe.
* Onboard a target number of event organizers within the first 6 months.
* Achieve first-page search engine ranking for "Indian cultural events in [target city]".
* Ensure high vendor satisfaction with the event submission and management process.
* Achieve high public user engagement, measured by low bounce rates and high usage of filter features.
* Maintain a consistent flow of new event submissions from vendors.

### Background Context

CulturaLite is a lightweight, full-stack event listing platform designed to solve the problem of fragmented and inefficient event discovery for the Indian cultural niche. Currently, event information is scattered across various platforms, making it difficult for the public to discover events and for organizers to reach their target audience.

The platform will provide a clean, fast, and SEO-optimized central hub for this community. It will feature distinct workflows for vendors to submit and manage events, for admins to moderate content, and for the public to discover and filter approved cultural events.
