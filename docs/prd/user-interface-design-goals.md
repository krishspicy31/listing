# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be clean, colorful, fast, and intuitive. The design should feel modern and welcoming, reflecting the vibrancy of Indian culture without becoming cluttered or overwhelming. For vendors, the workflow from login to event submission must be streamlined and efficient. For the public, the experience should be focused on joyful discovery and easy filtering.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Card-Based Layout**: Events will be displayed in a grid of cards, each providing a snapshot of key information.
* **Filter & Search**: The primary interaction for public users will be filtering events by city and category.
* **Dashboard Interface**: Vendors will manage their events from a clean, private dashboard.
* **Form-Based Submission**: Event creation will be handled through a multi-step or single-page form with clear validation.
* **Component-Driven UI**: The interface will be built using a consistent library of components (shadcn/ui).

### Core Screens and Views

* **Public-Facing Pages**:
    * Homepage (with event grid and filters)
    * City-Specific Event Listings Page
* **Vendor-Facing Pages**:
    * Login & Registration Page
    * Vendor Dashboard (view submitted events and their status)
    * Event Submission Form
* **Admin-Facing Interface**:
    * Django Admin Panel (for moderation)

### Accessibility

*To be determined, but aiming for modern best practices.*

### Branding

* **Color Palette**:
    * Primary: `#F97316` (Orange)
