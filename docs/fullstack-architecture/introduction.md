# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for CulturaLite, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a **Greenfield project**.

The project will be built from clean foundations using the official CLI tools for each major technology, rather than a third-party, all-in-one template. This approach provides maximum control and ensures the project starts with a clean, up-to-date, and un-opinionated codebase.

  * **Frontend Initialization:** `npx create-next-app@14`
  * **Backend Initialization:** `django-admin startproject`
