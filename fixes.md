✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/features/event-discovery/services/eventService.ts at line 94, implemented runtime validation by checking the presence and types of expected properties on the parsed JSON before treating it as ApiError. Added proper error handling for invalid response structures.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/features/event-discovery/services/eventService.ts at line 109, implemented runtime validation for EventListResponse structure by verifying the presence and types of expected properties (count, results, next, previous) before proceeding with type assertion.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/features/event-discovery/services/eventService.ts at line 196, removed the non-null assertion operator (!) from lastError and added explicit checks to ensure lastError is defined before using it, with fallback error creation if undefined.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/features/event-discovery/services/eventService.ts at line 135, improved network error detection by broadening the condition to catch all network-related TypeError instances, checking for multiple common network error message patterns instead of relying solely on 'fetch'.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/features/event-discovery/components/EventGrid.tsx around lines 70 to 76, replaced the placeholder console.log with proper navigation logic. Added onSubmitEvent prop to allow parent components to handle navigation, with fallback to '/login' page for event submission.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/features/event-discovery/components/EventGrid.tsx at line 180, replaced the aggressive window.location.reload() call with a more graceful retry mechanism. Added onRetry prop that allows parent components to provide custom retry logic without reloading the entire page, preserving user state.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/next.config.mjs around lines 11 to 16, replaced the wildcard '**' hostname pattern with specific trusted domain names including Cloudinary (res.cloudinary.com, cloudinary.com), placeholder services (via.placeholder.com), and Unsplash (images.unsplash.com) to restrict image loading and mitigate security risks.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/components/shared/LoadingSpinner.tsx around lines 95 to 106, removed the conflicting aria-hidden="true" attribute from InlineLoadingSpinner while keeping aria-label="Loading" to ensure screen readers can properly detect and announce the loading status.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-backend/apps/events/tests/test_views.py around lines 91 to 95, confirmed that the API always uses pagination (Django REST Framework with PAGE_SIZE: 20) and updated all test cases to consistently expect paginated results under 'results', removing unnecessary conditional checks for response format.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-backend/apps/events/tests/test_views.py around lines 262 to 267, replaced the basic 'T' and 'Z' checks with robust ISO 8601 validation using dateutil.parser.isoparse() to properly parse and validate the event_date format, ensuring it's a valid ISO 8601 datetime string.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/features/event-discovery/components/EventCard.tsx around lines 27 to 39, improved the formatEventDate function by adding checks for null/undefined dateString and invalid dates before processing. Enhanced error handling with proper logging and descriptive error messages for better debugging.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/features/event-discovery/components/EventCard.tsx around lines 54 to 72, updated the TruncatedText component to dynamically generate line-clamp classes based on the maxLines prop (e.g., 'line-clamp-' + maxLines) instead of hardcoding specific values, improving reusability for any number of lines.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-backend/apps/events/tests/test_api_integration.py around lines 210 to 220, refactored the test to use a new EventFactory class for standardized event creation and implemented a tearDown method to clean up created events after each test, preventing data pollution and maintenance issues.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-backend/apps/events/views.py around lines 56 to 60, replaced the broad except Exception clause with specific exception handling for DatabaseError, ValidationError, ValueError, and general Exception. Added proper logging and more informative error responses to improve debugging and error clarity.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-backend/create_pagination_test_data.py around lines 21 to 29, added try-except blocks around User.objects.get and Category.objects.get calls to catch DoesNotExist exceptions and provide clear error messages indicating which required data is missing, improving feedback and debugging.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-backend/create_test_data.py around lines 135 to 144, wrapped the Event.objects.create call in try-except blocks to catch IntegrityError and general database errors, added proper error logging and handling to ensure the script can continue gracefully when individual event creation fails.

✅ FIXED: In culturalite-frontend/src/app/page.tsx around lines 58 to 61, replaced the console.log in handleEventClick with a user-friendly alert showing event details and indicating that the event detail page is coming soon. Added proper router setup and commented future implementation for navigation to `/events/${event.id}`.
