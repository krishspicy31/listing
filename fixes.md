✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/app/page.tsx around lines 244 to 255, the motion.div animation does not respect the user's reduced motion preference, which is important for accessibility. Add a check for the user's reduced motion preference using window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches, and conditionally disable or simplify the animation by setting the initial, animate, and transition props accordingly when reduced motion is preferred.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/app/page.tsx around lines 60 to 63, the catch block uses a generic catch without capturing the error object, which limits error handling specificity. Modify the catch block to capture the error parameter, then handle or log specific error types or messages accordingly. This will improve debugging and allow setting more informative error states or messages based on the error details.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/app/page.tsx around lines 196 to 201, the current smooth scroll implementation does not handle the case when the target element with id 'events-section' is missing. Update the onStartBrowsing function to include error handling by checking if the element exists before calling scrollIntoView, and optionally log a warning or handle the absence gracefully to avoid runtime errors.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/app/page.tsx around lines 96 to 97, the catch block uses a generic catch without specifying the error parameter, which prevents handling specific error types. Modify the catch block to include an error parameter, then handle or log the error specifically before calling setOptionsError, ensuring more precise error management.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx around lines 164 to 175, the motion.a elements representing mobile menu links lack keyboard navigation support. To fix this, replace motion.a with a focusable element that supports keyboard events, such as motion.button or motion.div with appropriate role and tabIndex attributes, and add keyboard event handlers (e.g., onKeyDown) to handle Enter and Space keys to trigger the onClick behavior. This will ensure the mobile menu links are accessible via keyboard navigation.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx around lines 27 to 34, the scroll event handler is added without throttling, which can cause performance issues. Implement throttling on the handleScroll function to limit how often it runs during scrolling. Also, ensure the event listener is properly cleaned up in the return function of useEffect to avoid memory leaks.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx between lines 122 and 178, the mobile menu lacks proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support. To fix this, add appropriate ARIA roles such as role="menu" to the SheetContent container and role="menuitem" to each navigation link. Ensure the menu can be opened and closed using keyboard events like Enter and Escape, and manage focus appropriately by moving focus to the first menu item when opened and returning focus to the menu button when closed.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx around lines 44 to 48, the navigation items are currently rendered using anchor tags which cause full page reloads. Replace the anchor tags with Next.js Link components for client-side routing. Import Link from 'next/link' and wrap each navigation label with the Link component, passing the href as a prop to enable proper SPA navigation without page reloads.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/components/sections/CTABanner.tsx between lines 83 and 143, the checkmark SVG icon is repeated three times with identical properties and styling. To fix this, extract the SVG markup into a separate reusable React component or a constant, then replace each repeated SVG instance with this new component or constant to eliminate duplication and improve maintainability.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx around lines 142 to 147, the onClick handler scrolls to an element without handling the case where the element might not exist. Add error handling by checking if the element is null and, if so, log an error or handle the failure gracefully to avoid silent failures or runtime errors.

✅ COMPLETED: In culturalite-frontend/src/components/shared/Logo.tsx around lines 40 to 51, the SVG element lacks accessibility attributes. Add a meaningful aria-label or role="img" and a descriptive title element inside the SVG to improve screen reader support. Ensure the SVG is not marked aria-hidden="true" if it conveys important information.
